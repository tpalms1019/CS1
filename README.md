Portfolio for programs created in CS1

Hi, I am Teddy Palmer, a junior who just started coding. I really do wish I had started coding earlier since I find it to be such an enjoyable thing to doâ€”creating something out of literally nothing. This repository is a collection of my first works. Though rough, I hope they can be used in the future as something to compare to to illustrate my growth.
